    "\n",
    "A: Assertion statements are beneficial because if the requirement specified within the statement is not met, an error is returned, stopping the rest of the code from running. If only a bollean output, such as True or False, is raised when requirements are not met, the person running the code might miss that the requirement of the check was not met. By raising an error and stopping future code chunks from running, assertion statements help bring attention towards issues earlier. Finding issues earlier leads to less wasted time down the line."
